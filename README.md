## Setup
Install [Compass](http://compass-style.org/install/)

Use this command at the root directory to start compiling CSS
```
compass watch
```

## Styling
The sass directory is organized into four main folders:
* base - Global defaults, sass variables, and helper mixins
*	components - Reusable classes for default text, layout, and helper styles
* partials - Majority of the website's CSS, organized by page and page sections
* vendor - Other third party CSS
