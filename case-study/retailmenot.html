				<p class="body">
					One of my projects this summer was to redesign the RetailMeNot Apple Watch app. The first version included: nearby store deals and sharing. For the second version, they wanted to add the ability to search for stores, saved coupons as well as a visual update.
				</p>
				<p class="body">
					I worked with another intern to rearchitect, design and brand the second version of the Apple Watch app.

				The first idea wehad was making a menu with the 3 choices. However, we wanted to prioritize Nearby Deals since the use case is that users would open up their app while in a store. Having a menu would also add another step to the process.

						We played around with adding images into the store page to provide the page with more depth. However, due to the load times of images as well as not knowing where we would get images for each merchant outweighed the visual effect.
