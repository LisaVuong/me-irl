							<h2 class="title">Apple Watch App Redesign</h2>
							<p class="body">
								One of my projects this summer was to redesign the RetailMeNot Apple Watch app. The first version included: nearby store deals and sharing. For the second version, they wanted to add the ability to search for stores, saved coupons as well as a visual update.
								<br>
								<br>
								I worked with Morgan Edgerton, another intern to rearchitect, design and brand the second version of the Apple Watch app.
